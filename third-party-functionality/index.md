# Third Party Functionality

{% include "./../partials/beta-warning.md" %}

`cornerstoneTools` v3.0 comes with new third-party support, so that one can easily drop new common functionality into `cornerstoneTools`, then construct new custom `tool`s which upon core and third-party functionality.  

The third-party architecture comes with the advantage of not having to maintain a fork of the entire codebase, should you wish to include some custom/bespoke functionality. However, if you think something you have developed would be valued by the wider `cornerstone` community, please consider submitting a pull request and contributing it back.
